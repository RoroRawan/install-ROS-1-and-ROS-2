# install-ROS-1-and-ROS-2

#### Task 1 (ROS 1 on Ubuntu):

###### I installed ubuntu through powershell via WSLg and then installed ROS 1 on it.

#### Task 2 (ROS 2 on Xubuntu) on jetson nano:

###### I installed xubuntu through the following link https://xubuntu.org/download/ 
and then installed it on the VM virtualbox to be able to use the platform and then I installed ROS 2 on it through the terminal, After that using balenaEtcher we will insert the xubuntu image and put it either via flash or sd card to be burned in the jetson nano.
